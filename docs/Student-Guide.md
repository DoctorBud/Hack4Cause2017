## How big can my team be?

Teams can be anywhere from one to seven members. All members must register and RSVP for the event. 

## Will the Downtown Athletic Club (DAC) be open overnight?

Yes. The facility will remain open for hackathon participants through the weekend to support the event - this includes restroom and shower facilities :shower:. The DAC will only be open to the general public during normal business hours.

## I can't stay the whole time, can I still participate?

Of course! We realize that a weekend is a long time and people may need to attend to other commitments, or just sleep!:sleeping: 

We do, however, strongly encourage you to be present for the first few hours of the hackathon to see the idea pitches, as well as the final few hours for the presentations and judging.

## Can multiple teams take on the same challenge?

Yes! Participating teams may choose whichever “Goldilock” challenge strikes their interest. If you or your team is particularly skilled, you can also enter multiple challenges.
