# Challenge Submissions

Submitting a challenge to Hack for a Cause is a great jump start to a technological solution. Great developers from Eugene can use their tech skills to help bring a solution to life. To do this well, developers taking on your challenge will need the resources to create code that truely meets the needs of the challenge.

The fact that this event is only a weekend means developers need all the specs, assets, copy, and any other considerations at the beginning of the hackathon.

## Resources and Specs

Any restrictions on the application or data should be made apparent from the start.

Well written descriptions make for better development and a better product.

The more resources available the better. 

Here are some resource that will help developers with your challenge:

* Image assets
* Text copy
* List of data that is sensitve or restrictions with data

Making these resources easily available will also help teams with your challange.

## Additional Resources

A person representing the challenge on site for the hackathon is also a big help.
Developers may have further questions about the nature for the challenge or direction to head in meeting the challenge.

## Only 48 Hours of Development
Keep in mind that 48 hours may not be enough time to fully complete the challenge into a production ready solution.

The goal of hackathons is to explore the long term solving of the challenge. Last year saw some big successes that are still in use today. These successes took more than the course of the hackathon weekend to get to a viable long term solution.
