# Challenge Submissions

Submitting a challenge to Hack for a Cause is a great jump start to a technological solution. Great developers from Eugene can use their tech skills to help bring a solution to life. To do this well, developers taking on your challenge will need the resources to create code that truely meets the needs of the challenge.

The fact that this event is only a weekend means developers need all the specs, assets, copy, and any other considerations at the beginning of the hackathon.

Any restrictions should be made apparent from the start

Well written descriptions make for better development

The more resources available the better
