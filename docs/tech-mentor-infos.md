Friday 4-9PM at the DAC

As a Tech Mentor you will work with teams to get them signed-up for the H4C Slack, get them setup with a repo and set them up with a git client or show them the CLI.  You can also show up Saturday as a relief and just be helpful if you like.

It's mostly about having fun.

As you sign up you will be invited to the Hack4Cause Slack and you can join the #tech-mentors channel to get details on the repos, schedule etc.

It might be handy to have a computer with you.  Something portable is nice.

4PM come to the DAC boardroom lobby.  There should be signs... it's on the top floor.  Thre will be things happening and Dinner at 5-6PM and you can get to know folks.  If this sounds dumb to you, you can skip the dinner and show up at 6PM

Whenever you show up, look for other tech mentors or Mark.  If you don't know Mark, look for the "Ginger Sasquatch with the funny hat".

6PM The show starts with an intro, keynote from the mayor and city manager, 10 quick pitches from the challenges that ends around 7:30

Teams start forming around 8.  This is where you start being helpful.  As teams form, you will add them to the slack, invite them to the git repo, etc.  Once the teams have names, create a channel in the slack and a folder in the git repo.

Some of the team members might not know Slack or Git and require your patient tutalage.  You can also do the things to get them up and running.  Personally, I use GitKraken client with new folks.  Some prefer the Command Line.  Do whatever you think is best for your learner.

I think that about covers it.
